## Functionality
This program takes an input file of numbers to be sorted using Radix Sort.
The original array is displayed in the terminal.
Next, the array is sorted and displayed in the terminal once again.
The purpose of this program is to show how Radix Sort is implemented using LSD.

## How to Use
To use this program, the user will need to provide a formatted input file.

### Input File
This file will contain integers to fill the array.
Each value will be separated by a new line.
The first line of the file contains the number of integers in the file.

### There is 1 command-line argument:
* Input File Path

Here is an example:
* ../input.txt
