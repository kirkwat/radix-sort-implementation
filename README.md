## Functionality

The original array is displayed in the terminal.
Next, the array is sorted and displayed in the terminal once again.
The purpose of this program is to show how Radix Sort is implemented using LSD.

## How to Use
Compile and build with CMAKE. There is 1 command-line argument.

### Input File Path
This file will contain integers to fill the array.
Each value will be separated by a new line.
The first line of the file contains the number of integers in the file.

Here is an example:
